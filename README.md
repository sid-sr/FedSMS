# SMS Spam Classification using Federated Learning

A privacy-oriented SMS client built with React and Flask hosted on AWS.

## Notes:

1. Before running the backend (with `python backend/src/app.py`) ensure a virtual environment is created: go to the backend folder and type `python -m venv venv` and `source ./venv/bin/activate` and then run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the packages.
2. Environment variables have default values (in `backend/src/app.py`).
